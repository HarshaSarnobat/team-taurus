    <h2>Passage 1: The Rise of Renewable Energy</h2>
    <textarea readonly>
Over the past few decades, the global energy landscape has undergone significant transformation. As concerns about climate change have intensified, many nations have turned to renewable sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Unlike oil and coal, renewable energy sources are sustainable and produce little to no greenhouse gases. Although the transition has faced challenges—like high initial costs and the need for storage technology—the long-term benefits for the environment and energy security are undeniable. Investment in renewables has surged, and innovations continue to make them more efficient and accessible.

    <h2>Passage 2: The Life Cycle of Butterflies</h2>
    <textarea readonly>
Butterflies undergo a complex life cycle that includes four main stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult. This process, called metamorphosis, allows for dramatic transformation from one form to another. Female butterflies typically lay their eggs on host plants, which the emerging caterpillars will eat. During the larva stage, the caterpillar molts several times as it grows. Eventually, it forms a chrysalis and enters the pupal stage, where it undergoes rapid changes. After a few days or weeks, an adult butterfly emerges. This cycle plays a critical role in pollination and maintaining ecological balance.
